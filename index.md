## <span id="j1"><font color='darkblue' face="Georgia" size='5'>Biography</font></span>
<!-- ## I am currently on the academic job market. -->

I received my Ph.D. degree at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), worked with [Dr. Douglas M. Blough](http://blough.ece.gatech.edu/) in the Critical Networking Lab. I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (by courtesy) at [North Carolina State University (NCSU)](https://www.ncsu.edu/).
               
<!-- After getting the master degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in China, I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Tech in USA, and work with [Dr. Douglas M. Blough](http://blough.ece.gatech.edu/) on projects of maximizing performance for next-generation wireless networks, and developing network simulators. In addition, I was an instructor of an ECE undergraduate course, and responsible for lectures and supervising labs. -->

<!-- My research interests lie in the areas of next-generation networks and systems, spanning wireless networking, mmWave communication, mobile computing, optimization and machine learning for networks and systems. I am also involved in the project of developing the open-source network simulator [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/). -->

<!-- Rapid technological innovations are necessary to keep up with ever-accelerating human demands, and my long-term research goals are to increase the intelligence, capacity, and robustness of network systems that support emerging applications on mobile edges, and to enable the freedom experience via untethered and smart connectivity for work, entertainment, social connections, health, etc. Therefore, my research covers broad areas of networking, machine learning, computing, and communication, spanning: -->

Rapid technological innovations are necessary to keep up with ever-accelerating human demands, and my long-term research goals revolve around achieving pervasive user-centric applications through ubiquitous networking and intelligence. This vision is realized through generalization, virtualization, digitization, and softwarization designs, where the synergistic methodologies unlock the opportunities that support emerging applications on mobile edges, enabling untethered and smart connectivity for work, entertainment, social connections, health, etc. Specifically, my research covers broad areas of networking, machine learning, computing, and communication, spanning:

  * **networking and systems** (wireless, digital twins, Open RAN, and security)
  * **machine learning for data, networking, sensing, and security** (generative AI, distributed/reinforcement learning, data generation)
  * **mobile computing** (infrastructure mobility, UAVs, robotic networked systems)
  * **new communication paradigms** (mmWave, THz, nextG Wi-Fi) 
  * **optimization and resilience** (theory, large-scale models and systems)
  * **software development and simulation** (programmable networking, open-source testbed, ns-3)
