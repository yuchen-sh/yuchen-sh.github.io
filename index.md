## <span id="j1"><font color='darkblue' face="Georgia" size='5'>Biography</font></span>
<!-- ## I am currently on the academic job market. -->

I received my Ph.D. degree at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), worked with [Dr. Douglas M. Blough](http://blough.ece.gatech.edu/) in the Critical Networking Lab. I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (by courtesy) at [North Carolina State University (NCSU)](https://www.ncsu.edu/).
               
<!-- After getting the master degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in China, I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Tech in USA, and work with [Dr. Douglas M. Blough](http://blough.ece.gatech.edu/) on projects of maximizing performance for next-generation wireless networks, and developing network simulators. In addition, I was an instructor of an ECE undergraduate course, and responsible for lectures and supervising labs. -->

<!-- My research interests lie in the areas of next-generation networks and systems, spanning wireless networking, mmWave communication, mobile computing, optimization and machine learning for networks and systems. I am also involved in the project of developing the open-source network simulator [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/). -->

Rapid technological innovations are necessary to keep up with ever-accelerating human demands, and my long-term research goals are to increase the intelligence, capacity, and robustness of network systems that support emerging applications on mobile edges, and to enable the freedom experience via untethered and smart connectivity for work, entertainment, social connections, health, etc. Therefore, my research covers broad areas of networking, computing, and communication, spanning:

  * **networking and systems** (wireless, new architecture, protocols, algorithms, and security) 
  * **mobile computing** (infrastructure mobility, robotic networked systems)
  * **machine learning for networking, sensing, and system design** (distributed/on-device learning, self-awareness system, network data analytics)
  * **new communication paradigms** (mmWave, THz, nextG Wi-Fi) 
  * **optimization and resilience** (theory, large-scale systems)
  * **software development and simulation** (programmable networking, open-source testbed, ns-3)

**<font color='red'>I am looking for multiple Ph.D./M.S./Undergraduate students and Research Interns to work in the area of advanced networking and intelligence.</font>**

<!-- Full financial support will be offered in the form of teaching assistantship or research assistantship. -->

If you are a prospective student interested in applying to [NCSU](https://www.ncsu.edu/) and working with me, please drop me an email at yuchen.liu at ncsu dot edu with your CV, and I will do my best to help in your journey once we have a commitment to each other.
